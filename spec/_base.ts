// One browser window, held OPEN for the whole run, when the board asks to watch it
// (BOARD_ONE_WINDOW).
//
// Playwright gives each test its own context and page, and in a headed browser that means a window
// opening and closing around every test. Two things were tried and rejected: sharing only the
// context still let the per-test page close, and closing the last page of a context closes its
// window; sharing the page itself broke tests that were written to start from a fresh one.
//
// So: a worker-scoped context, and a worker-scoped KEEPALIVE page that opens once and never
// closes. The keepalive holds the window open for the whole run, while each test still gets its
// own fresh page (a tab) in that same window — full per-test isolation, one window that never
// blinks out. Only for watching; the deterministic suite never sets BOARD_ONE_WINDOW.
